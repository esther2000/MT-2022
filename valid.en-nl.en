My room is very small.
English is spoken in many countries.
There must be a better way to do this.
How are we doing today?
It stinks in here.
Where was it?
That won't make a difference.
I know the girl playing tennis.
A horseshoe and a four-leaf clover bring good luck.
She greeted him cheerfully as she always did.
Tom has a lemon tree in his backyard.

That's not true.
Thank you for the information.
I wouldn't have done it.
You're sleepy, so go to bed.
Write your name.
I'm badly wounded.

I'm prudent.
I hope I can go to Australia soon.
I go to church every day.
I'm breastfeeding.
The phone kept ringing.
Get out!
It's late. I have to go.
He is the last person I want to see now.
Do you think that Tom would go out with me?
Please speak French.
That's true, regrettably.
His house is across the street.
Have you experienced this?
I don't think that we have to do anything else today.
He'll probably win in the next election.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
How was your interview?
Can you touch your toes?
He was almost hit by a car.
I'm very glad school is over.
Tom is talking.
Have you written down the phone number?
Keep quiet!

I have to attend this class.
I'm very sad.
I visited Australia.
We have had plenty of snow this year.
I can barely understand what he's saying.
I found this restaurant by chance.
Tom is an idiot.
Tom'll understand.
Where do I start?
You must tighten the knot.
He wants to work in a factory.
I have to make a call.
This may not be a real diamond.
He is more clever than I am.
He's the love of my life.
I hate spiders.
Have you gone nuts?
Fire is always dangerous.
