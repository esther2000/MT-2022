I feel the same way about you.
It doesn't matter if there's a crowd.

We own a dog and a cat.
I have a feeling that she will come today.
We came dangerously close to freezing to death.
They all talked.

Do you find me attractive?
We don't have a pool.
Have you ever been on a helicopter?
She needs you.

Do you smoke?
I want to ask you some questions.
Look up.
Who committed this murder?

They were snowed in for a whole week.
It looks like a UFO.
I'm going to ask you something.

I can't bend over.
I have many friends in Australia.
Are you curious?
I could never hate you.

That's an interesting plan.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Walk slowly.
He ran away so he wouldn't be caught.
Tom is downstairs.
Whose book is that?
I'm sorry I've kept you waiting so long.
Use your brain.
I don't feel like it.
Tom got mad at us for doing that.
Tom didn't accept the invitation.
He's financially dependent on his wife.
Be specific.
What's new?

Where's the closest pharmacy?
Tom reads.
Nice shot!
I'm not happy about this situation.
He did not want war.
I wouldn't do that in a million years.
I showed my room to him.

I knew that today would be fun.
Where is Tom?
How often do you go abroad?
I think it's really special.
Please say hello to your wife for me.

Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.
Now wait a minute.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't be offended.
Tom sang a duet with Mary.
I went to Australia.
It's all yours.
She bent down.
Tom should've protected Mary.
She gave me the evil eye.
Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
Really?
Have you read the notice?
Help me and I'll help you.
How absurd!
I think it's really important that we do that.

We don't have to talk about this now.
Join us.
They know me.
Do you want to talk about it or not?
This isn't healthy.
I've always been interested in botany.
