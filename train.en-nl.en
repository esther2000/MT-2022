I'm going to go back to the hospital.
How did you end up here?
I'll call you tomorrow.
We need to get away.
Tell me about it.
I need an assistant.
That serves you right.

I have a laptop.
I found that embarrassing.
Do you want chips with that?
Tom resigned.
Does Tom eat fish?

I go out sometimes for a beer.
Go do your homework.
Next person, please.

This is your key.
Everyone noticed.
Thanks for your reply.
I shouldn't have done that.
Tom said that.
I haven't bought any Christmas presents.
I spoke slowly so that they might understand me.
That flower has a strong smell.
Who are these people?
He went up to her and they shook hands.
He must be crazy to behave like that.
I don't like living alone.
If it happens again, please let me know right away.
Tom shouldn't have borrowed so much money from Mary.
We got here a couple of hours ago.
I hope you won't mind if I give you some advice.

I need anti-itch ointment.
Do you have a website?
What do you think of this plan?
Termites eat wood.
Listen to the music.
This bike is easy to ride.
Please give me a hamburger.

I know you know I know.
You need to hide.
I didn't know Tom last year.
Get out!
Are you free this weekend?
One should take care of oneself.
I suck at this.
The patient screamed in agony.
Did you buy tomatoes?
A Japanese would not have said such a thing.
I can do it.
Do you have an appointment?
I'm not nervous.
Something's wrong.
I am sorry to cancel the appointment at the last minute.
Tom looked a little frightened.
This is the window which was broken by the boy.
It's extremely hard.
I'm still not very good at French.
I can't taste anything.
Do you like it or not?
This bedroom doesn't get very much sunlight.
